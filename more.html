        <h2>Types of Parking Lots</h2>
        <p>There are various types of parking lots:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>*Open-air parking lots*: These are outdoor spaces where vehicles can park. They are commonly found near shopping centers, stadiums, and recreational areas.</li>
            <li>*Multi-level parking garages*: Also known as parking structures or car parks, these provide multiple levels of parking. They are often seen in urban areas with limited space.</li>
            <li>*Underground parking facilities*: These are located below ground level and are commonly found in city centers or large buildings. They offer protection from weather conditions.</li>
            <!-- Add more types as needed -->
        </ul>

        <h2>Parking Lot Management</h2>
        <p>Effective parking lot management involves several key practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>*Optimizing space usage*: Efficiently allocating parking spots to maximize capacity.</li>
            <li>*Implementing payment systems*: Providing options for hourly, daily, or monthly payments.</li>
            <li>*Ensuring security and surveillance*: Installing cameras, proper lighting, and security personnel to prevent theft and vandalism.</li>
            <li>*Regular maintenance and cleaning*: Keeping the lot clean, well-marked, and free from debris.</li>
            <li>*Providing clear signage for drivers*: Clearly indicating entrances, exits, reserved spots, and pedestrian pathways.</li>
            <li>*Monitoring occupancy and availability*: Using technology to track available spaces and guide drivers to open spots.</li>
        </ul>
